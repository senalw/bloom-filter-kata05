# bloom-filter-kata05
Bloom filters are a 30-year-old statistical way of testing for membership in a set. They greatly reduce the amount of  storage you need to represent the set, but at a price: they’ll sometimes report that something is in the set when it  isn’t (but it’ll never do the opposite; if the filter says that the set doesn’t contain your object, you know that it  doesn’t)
